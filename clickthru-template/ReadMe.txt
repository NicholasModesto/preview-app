## Getting Started

Step 1: Name your images in numerical order.  Be sure to follow a double digit naming convention (01, 02, 03, 04, etc..).
Step 2: Drop your images (JPEG, PNG, BMP, ETC...) into the "images" folder.
Step 3: Rename the "clickthru-template" folder to what ever you want as long as it plays nice with URLs (aka avoid things like odd punction marks and special characters).
Step 4: Drop the newly renamed folder onto a webserver that can run PHP and you are set.
